                    <li>
                      Base Damage Period: Base Damage is on between Friday
                      1:00pm EST and Sunday 10:00pm EST. This doesn't stop you
                      from hopping over a wall or cracking someone's code lock
                      during the week when base damage is off.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Base Claiming and Stealing: You may not claim/steal a base
                      with a flagpole set up. You may ONLY steal or claim a base
                      with no flagpole, and if you change all entrance locks
                      leading to the heart of the base. If you're solo and do
                      not want to lose your base, build a flag pole. DayZ flags
                      can be collected from the trader.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Disconnecting in Bases: Do not disconnect inside other
                      people's bases under any circumstances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Respect for Base Items: Do not despawn/ruin/dismantle
                      things unnecessarily. Do not deconstruct flag poles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      No Unauthorized Building Modifications: You must NOT build
                      into or in other people's bases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Boosting Raid Using Tents or Players: You may boost raid
                      using tents or other players. Tents used for boosting must
                      be packable and must not clip into walls/fences/etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Exploitative Tactics Ban: You must NOT garden
                      plot/fireplace/or swim to gain access to someone's base.
                      Stay away from these exploits or you will be banned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Reclaiming Stolen Bases: If you log into a base that was
                      previously yours but has been stolen, you are not allowed
                      to raid it or log back out. If you log in to your now
                      stolen base, you have three options:
                    </li>
                    <li>a. Suicide your character</li>
                    <li>
                      b. Jump out or dismantle out (only enough walls that lead
                      to your exit)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      c. Contact the people who stole your base and make an
                      arrangement for a peaceful exit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Risks of Stealing Bases: If you steal a base and the
                      previous owners load in and kill you, that's the risk you
                      take with stealing a base. They still must abide by all
                      other above rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Stolen Base on Raid Weekend: If you load in during a raid
                      weekend, and your base is stolen, your ONLY option is to
                      suicide your character.

                      Military Area Building Restrictions: Do NOT build in the
                      designated military areas listed below (within perimeter
                      limits): M B Kamensk, M B Tisy, M B VMC, M B Zeleno, NWAF,
                      Krasno Airfield, and any military checkpoints.

                    <li>
                      Coastal Building Restrictions: Do not build in any coastal
                      town or directly on the coast. This includes the whole of
                      Berezino. This excludes the following (i.e. you can base
                      in the towns mentioned below): Prison Island, Vysotovo,
                      Novoselki, Dubovo, and Skalisty Island.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Base Accessibility: You may not build an un-raidable base.
                      If you have one entrance, that entrance must be a gate. If
                      you're on a ladder, that ladder must be climbable. You may
                      NOT use tents/watchtower logs to block entrances. You may
                      NOT use logs or tents to block ladders. Ladders must be
                      climbable. You may NOT block roads with fences/gates, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Claiming Buildings: You may only claim one large building
                      for your faction (this includes anything that is connected
                      to that building) and an unlimited number of small
                      buildings. A large building may be a single apartment
                      block, a double apartment block, a large warehouse, or
                      connecting apartments. A small building may be a single
                      house, garage, or shed.
                    </li>
                    <li>SkyBases Prohibition: No SkyBases.</li>
                    <li>
                      Flagpole Limit and Alliance Restrictions: You may build a
                      maximum of 2 flagpoles to cover your base. You may NOT
                      ally with a team and wall around multiple buildings via
                      one large courtyard. They must be independent bases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Flag Usage and Faction Responsibilities: Flags may not be
                      lowered for the intention of hiding them during raid
                      weekend. A faction may only lower their own flag to move
                      base or move the location of a flagpole. If you are in a
                      faction, you must pick up your flag before raid weekend.
                      Failure to do so risks faction disband or BMD fine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Storage Items Regulations: All storage items must not
                      abuse the "build mod" and must be able to be packed and
                      stolen. If you have to boost or build to unpack a tent,
                      this placement is considered NOT allowed. You will be
                      forced to destroy it and pay the raiders for the tent they
                      couldn't steal.

                    <li>
                      Watchtower Height Limit: Watchtowers can only be stacked
                      two high/6 floors.
